    <h2 class="text-md md:text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What Counts as a Dental Emergency?</h2>
    <p class="my-3">
    Not every toothache or chipped tooth requires rushing to the dentist, but some situations demand immediate attention. Dental emergencies are cases where delaying treatment could result in severe pain, infection, or permanent damage.
    </p>
    <h4 class="font-bold my-2">Common examples of dental emergencies include:</h4>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
      <li>Severe or persistent toothaches that don’t improve with painkillers</li>
      <li>Knocked-out teeth from accidents or sports injuries</li>
      <li>Cracked or broken teeth exposing nerves or causing bleeding</li>
      <li>Swelling in the face or gums caused by infections or abscesses</li>
      <li>Loose or lost fillings, crowns, or bridges that leave teeth vulnerable</li>
      <li>Excessive bleeding from oral injuries</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-2">If you’re unsure whether your situation qualifies as an emergency, it’s better to err on the side of caution. Calling an emergency dentist like SmileKraft Dental can save you time, money, and unnecessary discomfort.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section class="mb-8">
    <h2 class="text-md md:text-2xl font-bold mb-4 ">Why Emergency Dentistry Matters</h2>
    <p class="mb-2">Dental issues aren’t just about teeth-they affect your overall health. A painful abscess, for example, is more than an oral problem; the infection can spread to other parts of your body if left untreated. Similarly, ignoring a knocked-out or broken tooth can reduce the chances of saving it.</p>
    <p class="mb-2">Seeking emergency dentistry right away ensures:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
      <li><strong>Pain relief</strong> - fast treatment to manage discomfort</li>
      <li><strong>Preservation of natural teeth</strong> - increasing the likelihood of saving damaged teeth</li>
      <li><strong>Prevention of complications</strong> - stopping infections before they spread</li>
      <li><strong>Peace of mind </strong> - knowing you have a trusted local dentist ready to help</li>
    </ul>

    Handling Different Dental Emergencies
  </h2>

  <p class="mb-4">
    Every emergency is different, and knowing what steps to take before reaching the
    dentist can make a big difference.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-lg md:text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Severe Toothache</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Tooth pain that won’t go away often signals infection or nerve damage. Rinse with warm water,
    floss gently to remove debris, and avoid applying aspirin directly to the gums. Call your
    emergency dentist immediately.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-lg md:text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Knocked-Out Tooth</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Time is critical. Pick up the tooth by the crown (not the root), rinse it gently, and place
    it back into the socket if possible. If not, store it in milk or keep it moist in your mouth.
    Visit SmileKraft Dental within 30 minutes for the best chance of saving it.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-lg md:text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Cracked or Broken Teeth</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    A small chip may wait for a scheduled visit, but deep cracks exposing the tooth’s pulp require
    urgent treatment. Rinse with warm water and apply a cold compress to reduce swelling.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-lg md:text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">4. Dental Abscess</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    A swollen face, pus, or fever can indicate a dangerous infection. These should never be ignored.
    Contact your emergency dentist immediately to prevent further complications.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-lg md:text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">5. Lost Fillings or Crowns</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Temporary dental kits may provide relief, but they are no substitute for professional care.
    Avoid chewing on that side and schedule an emergency visit to prevent more damage.

  <h3 class="text-lg md:text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Importance of Pediatric Dentistry</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Early dental visits set the stage for a lifetime of healthy smiles. Pediatric dentistry isn't just about 
    fixing cavities; it's about <strong>prevention, education, and guidance</strong>. Children who see a dentist 
    regularly are more likely to avoid tooth decay, gum disease, and orthodontic problems later.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-2">By starting early, dentists can:</p>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
    <li>Catch small issues before they become major problems</li>
    <li>Teach kids proper brushing and flossing techniques</li>

    A root canal is not just about eliminating discomfort — it’s about preventing infection,
    maintaining chewing comfort, and avoiding costly tooth replacements like implants or
    bridges. With modern technology and compassionate care at SmileKraft, the process is
    smooth and far less intimidating than most people expect.

  <h3 class="text-lg md:text-2xl font-bold mb-4">When Do You Need a Root Canal?</h3>

  <p class="mb-4">
    Not every toothache requires a root canal, but certain symptoms should never be ignored.
    When infection reaches the pulp (the innermost part of the tooth), urgent treatment is
    necessary. Common warning signs include:
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
    <li><strong>Severe, persistent tooth pain</strong> that worsens when chewing</li>
    <li><strong>Sensitivity to hot or cold</strong> even after the source is removed</li>
    <li><strong>Swollen or tender gums</strong>, sometimes with pimple-like abscesses</li>
    <li><strong>Darkening or discoloration</strong> due to internal damage</li>
    <li><strong>Swelling in the face or jaw</strong> caused by spreading infection</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-4">
    If you notice these symptoms, early treatment at SmileKraft Dental greatly increases
    the chances of saving your natural tooth.

  <h3 class="text-lg md:text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Root Canal Procedure Explained Simply</h3>

  <p class="mb-4">
    A root canal at SmileKraft Dental is designed to be efficient, effective, and as
    comfortable as possible. Here is what typically happens:
  </p>

  <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
    <li><strong>Numbing the tooth</strong> — Local anesthesia prevents pain.</li>
    <li><strong>Accessing the pulp</strong> — A small opening is made to remove infection.</li>
    <li><strong>Cleaning and shaping</strong> — The canals are disinfected and shaped.</li>
    <li><strong>Sealing the tooth</strong> — Special filling blocks reinfection.</li>
    <li><strong>Strengthening with a crown</strong> — Often added to restore full function.</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="mb-4">
    With modern techniques, most patients say a root canal feels no more uncomfortable
    than getting a regular filling.

  <h3 class="text-lg md:text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Root Canals Are Better Than Extractions</h3>

  <p class="mb-4">Pulling an infected tooth may seem easier, but saving it has major benefits:</p>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
    <li><strong>Preserves natural function</strong> — chewing, biting, and speaking remain normal.</li>
    <li><strong>Prevents teeth from shifting</strong> — missing teeth lead to misalignment.</li>
    <li><strong>Prevents jawbone loss</strong> — extractions weaken the bone over time.</li>
    <li><strong>Saves money</strong> — implants and bridges cost much more long-term.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-4">
    A root canal lets you keep your natural tooth and avoid unnecessary complications.

  <h3 class="text-lg md:text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Life After a Root Canal: What to Expect</h3>

  <p class="mb-4">
    Recovery is usually quick. Mild tenderness may occur for a few days. SmileKraft often
    recommends a crown to reinforce the tooth and restore its natural appearance.
  </p>

  <p class="font-semibold mb-2">Tips for a smooth recovery:</p>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
    <li>Avoid hard foods on the treated tooth until fully restored</li>
    <li>Brush and floss daily to prevent new infections</li>
    <li>Attend follow-up visits to ensure proper healing</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-4">
    With proper care, a tooth treated with a root canal can last a lifetime.
